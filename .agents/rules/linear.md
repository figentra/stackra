# Linear

Team `STA` tracks all work (ADR 0065, ADR 0121 D14). **Work is not done until its Linear issue is in the right
state.** Every agent, including subagents and OpenCode executors without the Linear MCP, uses `pnpm linear`:

| When                       | Run                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Starting work              | `pnpm linear start STA-n` (In Progress, comment with the branch) |
| Opening the PR             | `pnpm linear review STA-n <pr-url>` (In Review, PR attached)     |
| Merged / finished          | `pnpm linear done STA-n <link>`                                  |
| Progress, findings, blocks | `pnpm linear comment STA-n "<text>"`                             |
| New work found             | `pnpm linear create --title "…" [--project p] [--labels a,b]`    |
| What is open               | `pnpm linear mine`, `pnpm linear open [--label owner]`           |

- Branch names are Linear's (`<user>/sta-<n>-<slug>`). A `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commit carries
  `Refs: STA-n`. The PR title or branch names the key, or the PR is labelled `chore-lane`.
- `pnpm delegate` needs `--issue STA-n`. Issues an agent creates get the `agent` label automatically.
- Actions run as the "Stackra Agent" app, which is the issue's delegate. The human assignee is never changed.
- Tokens come from Infisical only (`pnpm linear` wraps `infisical run --env=dev --path=/agents`). Never print one.
- A Linear failure never blocks a gate (ADR 0065 rule 7). The nightly `Linear sync` workflow repairs drift.

## Enforcement

`commitlint.config.mjs` (`refs-linear-key`, lefthook and the Quality Gate over the PR range); `linear.mjs check-pr`
in the Quality Gate; `requireIssue` in `tools/scripts/delegate.mjs`; `.github/workflows/linear-sync.yml`
(`tools/scripts/linear-reconcile.mjs`) moves states, closes decided ADR issues and labels stale work.
