# Task vocabulary

Members use these names and no synonyms (`tsc`, `check-types`, `fmt`, `cov`, `serve` are wrong):

A member declares only the scripts it has work for (a docs app has no `typecheck`; `tooling` presets have no
`build`). Services and apps also have `start`; Expo has `ios`, `android`, `doctor`; docs has `a11y`.

Root: `pnpm build|typecheck|lint|test|clean` run `turbo run <task>`. `pnpm gen` runs `turbo run gen:workspace gen`:
`gen:workspace` is the root-only `stackra gen` pass over every member with a `stackra.config.ts`, and `gen` each
member's own. Root `pnpm format|format:check` run oxfmt
over the whole repository (root files included) plus shfmt on `*.sh`, not turbo. `pnpm check` is
format:check + lint + typecheck. `pnpm verify` is the full gate (add `validate`, `boundaries`, `knip`);
`pnpm verify:affected` limits it to changed members. Run one member with `pnpm --filter <name> <script>`.

A new task name goes in `turbo.jsonc` and in every member of that shape together.

Enforcement: `tools/scripts/validate-repository.mjs` checks the script set per member shape; `turbo.jsonc` is the
task graph.
