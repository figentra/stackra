# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `.agents/specs/sta-n-<slug>/`

**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Rules (checked by `node tools/scripts/spec-gate.mjs tasks <tasks.md>`)

- Line format: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] <description> in <path> — covers: FR-003, P-002 — route: spec-task — deps: T010`
  - `T###` ids are unique and permanent; an amendment strikes a task (`~~T012~~ (A-001)`), never renumbers.
  - `covers:` names spec or plan IDs (FR-###, SC-###, EC-##, P-###) that exist; every FR is covered by a task.
  - `route:` is a task type in `.agents/routing.yaml`.
  - `deps:` names earlier tasks; dependencies are acyclic.
  - `[P]` tasks in one phase are a wave: they never share a backticked path.
- Phases: Setup, Foundational, one per user story (US1…USn), Polish. Each phase heading carries its Linear key once
  `/speckit.taskstoissues` has run (`## Phase 3: US1 … [STA-m]`); task lines carry ` [STA-m]` at the end.
- Tests sit in `__tests__/` beside their subject (ADR 0022) and carry `@covers sta-n:FR-###` (spec-trace).
- Do not keep sample tasks.

## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 [description] in `path` — covers: FR-001 — route: spec-task

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: [what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [how to verify it on its own]

- [ ] T002 [P] [US1] [test first] in `path/__tests__/x.test.ts` — covers: FR-001 — route: tests — deps: T001
- [ ] T003 [US1] [implementation] in `path` — covers: FR-001 — route: spec-task — deps: T002

## Phase N: Polish

- [ ] T0NN [P] Docs listed under Impact "Docs to update" in `apps/docs/src/...` — covers: SC-001 — route: steward-docs
