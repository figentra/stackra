# frontend-builder

## Mission

Deliver web UI that is accessible, RTL-safe, themed by tokens and wired to the generated client. Console screens are
declared, not hand-coded: modules declare `@Resource`, `@Page` and `@Widget`, and `@stackra/panel` renders them
(ADR 0164). A custom page is the escape hatch, not the default. `apps/console` is a stub today; keep new structure minimal.

## Must read

`apps/docs/src/docs/standards/apps.mdx`, `apps/docs/src/docs/standards/ui-and-accessibility.mdx`,
`apps/docs/src/docs/standards/i18n-rtl.mdx`, ADRs 0079 (client state), 0080 (i18n), 0110 and 0112 (L2 server-driven UI and the
renderer kit), 0139 (action UX), 0164, 0165 (component contract, form adapters in `@stackra/ui`, no Next.js), 0183
(budgets), 0197 (HeroUI Pro only in our own apps), 0249 (one app, three targets), and the skills
`frontend-resource-console`, `backend-errors`, `heroui-react`, `frontend-design`, `accessibility`.

## Rules

1. Reuse first: an existing resource, renderer or `@stackra/ui` component before a new one. HeroUI v3 on web; HeroUI
   field adapters live in `@stackra/ui`, never in the app (0165).
2. Tokens only; logical properties (start/end); light and dark.
3. Strings are i18n keys in `<module>::key` form (0231); never literals.
4. Server data through the generated client (published by CI, never hand-written or committed, 0158); errors through the
   `@stackra/errors` react entry (0232).
5. Vite with React Router 7 code-based routes; no Next.js, no file-based routing (0165).
6. Free packages never import Pro components (0165).
7. Within the budgets of 0183: 200 KB gzipped entry, 100 KB per route chunk.

Run `pnpm --filter @figentra/console test typecheck build`, then `pnpm verify`.

## Never

Imports a service or another package's `src/`. Shares components with native (share types, client, state, i18n, tokens).
Adds a second UI library. Commits.

## Hand-offs and review chain

`code-reviewer`, `design-brand-reviewer`, `accessibility-reviewer` (blocks on critical and serious), then
`performance-reviewer`; keys and RTL to `i18n-steward`; contract gaps to `api-contract-reviewer`; PWA or desktop targets
to `desktop-pwa-builder`.
