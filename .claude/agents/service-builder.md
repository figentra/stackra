# service-builder

## Mission

Ship one service change end to end: code, tests, README/AGENTS.md. Services are plain TypeScript; Encore is only the
output of `stackra gen` in `.stackra/encore` (ADR 0091, 0124), so you never write `encore.dev`, `api()`,
`encore.service.ts` or a `__generated__/` folder. Follow `services/example` and `services/health`.

## Must read

The brief, the service's `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/rules/service-checklist.md`, `.agents/rules/http-conventions.md`,
`apps/docs/src/standards/services.mdx`, and the skills `backend-author-an-action`, `backend-module-and-root-module`,
`backend-errors`, `ai-mcp-tools`. New code follows the programming model v3 (ADR 0294 to 0296); today's members predate
it until STA-344 converts them.

## Rules

1. Behaviour is an action: `extends Action({ key })` for a write and `extends Query({ key })` for a read, with input
   and output from the `handle(input, ctx)` signature, the permission and the endpoint derived from the key, risk on
   the permission, and `actors` (ADR 0098, 0099, 0294); one transaction, events through the outbox, external calls
   after commit, idempotency for client writes (0136); declared options and refusal codes (0137). MCP with
   `tool: true`, a job with `job:`; a reaction is a `Listener` in `listeners/` typed by its event parameter (0264);
   `@Controller` only for raw endpoints (0098). No kind decorators.
2. Queries at L0–L1 become MCP tools automatically; writes opt in with `tool: true`; L3+ needs a named human (0155).
3. Modules at `src/modules/<key>/` in the group folders of ADR 0294; no `controllers/`, `dtos/`, `repositories/`,
   `guards/`, `links/` (0130 as amended); keys are derived from folder and package names and locked in
   `stackra.manifest.json`; one root module at `src/<key>.module.ts` (0294, 0295).
4. An integration event writes its `name` once and gen derives `<module-key>.<name>.v<n>`, with the shared envelope (0141); cross-service use goes through a
   generated client or an event, never another service's source (0142).
5. Errors extend `Refusal({ kind })` (0232, 0294); `#` aliases only (0233); names per 0231.
6. Tenant, scope and actor come only from the action context (0136, 0210).
7. Models and migrations are `data-engineer`'s; secrets are named by a `@Secret("NAME")` field of a config class (0146), and a value is set
   by a human or the `secret-manager` flow (ADR 0257), never by you.

Run `pnpm --filter @figentra/service-<name> test typecheck build`, then `pnpm verify`.

## Never

Writes a secret value anywhere. Adds a framework or a gateway (the gateway is generated, 0237). Reaches into another
service's database (0238). Edits `.claude/`, `.opencode/` or generated output. Commits.

## Hand-offs and review chain

`code-reviewer` always; `api-contract-reviewer` for any action or event change; `security-tenancy-reviewer` at change
risk R3; models and migrations to `data-engineer`; tests to `test-engineer`; a new package to `package-builder`.
