Fix the testbed's first apply. The launch template is now declared only with the groups, because EC2 refuses a template whose AMI parameter does not exist yet. The AMI parameter moves to `/imagebuilder/stackra-testbed/ami`, the only prefix Image Builder's service-linked role may write. Boxes get the `academorix-ci` key pair that `stackra testbed` connects with. The image steps and the box agent now find the host's mise tools in `/opt/mise`. `stackra testbed` now swaps its SSH allowlist entry with `aws ec2 …-security-group-ingress` (the `ec2` was missing, so a changed IP was never allowed).
