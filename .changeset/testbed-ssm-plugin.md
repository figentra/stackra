"@stackra/cli": patch
---

`stackra testbed` finds the aws CLI's Session Manager plugin itself: on `PATH`, else the mise-installed copy
(`mise which`, then mise's install folder), whose folder it puts first on `PATH` for the `aws` and `ssh` it starts.
Without the plugin, `run` exits 75 at once and says why instead of waiting on "no healthy testbed box" while the boxes
are healthy (what every run outside a mise-activated shell did from 2026-11-04), and `status` names the reason a box
did not answer.
