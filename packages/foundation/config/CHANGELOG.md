# @stackra/config

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ae3d280: Add the `@stackra/config/contracts` entry and move the `SecretStore` port into it (one symbol, one entry): import it from
  `@stackra/config/contracts`; `@stackra/config` no longer exports it. Dependants import from the new entry.
- 2787c1e: Add `@stackra/config`, configuration classes of the programming model v3.1: the called-only kind base
  `Config({ schema, env })` whose class is the DI token and whose schema fields are typed on the class, host overrides
  under the `Base<Name>` alias, `configKey` (the key derivation gen shares), `@Secret("NAME")` on schema, integration and
  connection fields resolved blind through the `SecretStore` port and never serialised, `buildConfig` with the fixed
  layers (schema defaults, host override, env, runway values, secrets) validated and frozen, `ConfigInvalidError` naming
  paths, variables and secrets but never values, `hydrateEnv` for the public part (`PublicPart`, `BuildFacts`) or the
  whole env instance, the `env` value parsers folded in from the old `./env` entry; `./react` with `useConfig`; and
  `./testing`, which adds `.withConfig(Class, values)` and `.withSecrets(map)` to the testing module.
- a1fd4d6: Add the `InfisicalSecretStoreDriver` with `InfisicalConfig` and the `AwsSecretsManagerSecretStoreDriver` (`./node`) with
  `AwsSecretsManagerConfig`; both load once at boot and never list or report a value. `@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager`
  is an optional peer.
- 396e384: Packages ship their `stackra.manifest.json` (listed in `files`), and the manifest gains a `config` section that gen
  reads for package config rows instead of the `*Config` name suffix. `stackra gen --check` refuses an unshipped manifest
  (`manifest_unshipped`). New memory drivers: `ConnectionStore` (integrations), `ScopeResolver` (scope),
  `RealtimeFanout` (realtime), `ErrorReporter` (errors), `SecretStore` (config) and `FlagProvider` (feature-flags).
  Generated file headers keep ` *` on continuation lines, so every generated header changes on the next regeneration.

### Patch Changes

- 0a7eaf1: Lint: the rule-gap B-3 autofix sweep (stackra-231, owner D11). `@stackra/oxlint-config` turns on
  `unicorn/numeric-separators-style`, `unicorn/switch-case-braces`, `unicorn/prefer-string-replace-all` and
  `unicorn/catch-error-name` at `error`. `unicorn/number-literal-case` stays off: it wants uppercase hex digits and oxfmt
  prints them lowercase, so the two would fight.
  
  The packages listed change no API and no behaviour. Long numeric literals carry `_` separators, every `case` body is a
  block, `.replace(/x/g, ...)` is `.replaceAll(...)` (a plain string where the pattern was a plain string), and a caught
  error is named `error`, or `<name>Error` where an outer `error` is in scope. Log and error `cause` fields keep their key.
- abb1d69: Lint: rule-gap B-4 (stackra-232, owner D11). `@stackra/oxlint-config` turns on
  `typescript/method-signature-style` with `"property"` at `error`. A method signature in an interface or type literal is
  checked bivariantly even under `strictFunctionTypes`, so a driver could accept a narrower argument than its port
  promises. Every port, type and augmentation in the packages listed now spells its members as properties
  (`find: (id: string) => Promise<T>`), which TypeScript checks strictly.
  
  No runtime change. The type surface is stricter: an implementation, fake or object literal whose parameter is narrower
  than the port's now fails to typecheck, as it always should have. Module augmentations (`Matchers<R>`, `Blueprint`,
  `TestingModuleBuilder`, `TestingApp`) use the same property form.
- e756399: Publish to the Stackra registry (ADR 0453): every free `@stackra/*` package is `"private": false` (ADR 0461) with `publishConfig` `{ access: public, provenance: true }` and no registry of its own; the release workflow's `registry` input, `https://npm.stackra.figentra.com/`, is the one place it is set. The packed manifest drops the repo-only `@stackra/source` export condition. `@stackra/runway` types `providers.npm` (`registry`, `scope`); `@stackra/repo-checks` refuses a member `publishConfig.registry`; `stackra new` writes none.
