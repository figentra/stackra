# @stackra/infra-aws

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- f7971a1: Refuse backups that would leave an environment region's jurisdiction, name the jurisdiction in the config, hold the
  static egress addresses `shared.network.egress.staticIps` asks for and export them for partner allow-lists
  (`egressIps`, `egressAllocationIds`), and add the `AwsHealthIndicatorDriver` (ADR 0402).
- 58d9f32: Add `@stackra/infra-aws`, the free AWS foundation as Pulumi programs read from the root runway (ADR 0171): per
  environment `awsBaseline` (a provider pinned to the account with cost tags, a rotating data key, the files bucket with
  the media CORS rule and replication to the backup account, Postgres point-in-time recovery and 35-day snapshot copies,
  the GitHub OIDC infra role, the Encore Cloud role and the budget that stops non-production spend), `stateBackend` and
  `backupAccount` for the account-wide stacks, the config readers `awsBaselineConfig` and `awsAccounts`, `resolveRef`,
  and `./testing` with `mockPulumi` and `outputOf`.

### Patch Changes

- 697fe4b: Refuse database backups kept past 35 days unless the runway states `shared.database.backups.cryptoShredded: true`
  (ADR 0188 decision 3), so a backup never outlives an erasure.
- 04133f8: The files bucket follows `filesystem.disk` only: a runway `media.disk` is no longer read (ADR 0465 folded `MediaDisk`
  into `FileSystem`, so media stores through the file disk). A root runway that put only `media.disk` on `s3` now needs
  `filesystem.disk: s3` to keep its files bucket.
- 038966e: Rule-gap B-1, B-2 and B-5 (stackra-230, owner D11). `base.jsonc` now has no warn level left: the `suspicious`
  category and `react/exhaustive-deps` are `error`, and every warning they raised (81) is fixed or carries a reasoned
  disable. `unicorn/no-array-sort` is on (a bare `x.sort();` statement passes; tests are off), with
  `no-promise-executor-return`, `unicorn/prefer-code-point`, `unicorn/prefer-structured-clone` and `unicorn/prefer-spread`.
  
  The packages listed change no API. toSorted and toReversed are ES2023 and the base lib is ES2022, so a TypeScript site
  that sorts or reverses an array it just built carries a reasoned disable; the Node-only `.mjs` tools use toSorted.
  Promise executors have block bodies; `String.fromCharCode` is `String.fromCodePoint`; byte-level `charCodeAt`, hashes
  and deliberate JSON round trips keep their form with a reason; typed-array `.slice()` copies are `new Uint8Array(x)`.
- 0a7eaf1: Lint: the rule-gap B-3 autofix sweep (stackra-231, owner D11). `@stackra/oxlint-config` turns on
  `unicorn/numeric-separators-style`, `unicorn/switch-case-braces`, `unicorn/prefer-string-replace-all` and
  `unicorn/catch-error-name` at `error`. `unicorn/number-literal-case` stays off: it wants uppercase hex digits and oxfmt
  prints them lowercase, so the two would fight.
  
  The packages listed change no API and no behaviour. Long numeric literals carry `_` separators, every `case` body is a
  block, `.replace(/x/g, ...)` is `.replaceAll(...)` (a plain string where the pattern was a plain string), and a caught
  error is named `error`, or `<name>Error` where an outer `error` is in scope. Log and error `cause` fields keep their key.
- abb1d69: Lint: rule-gap B-4 (stackra-232, owner D11). `@stackra/oxlint-config` turns on
  `typescript/method-signature-style` with `"property"` at `error`. A method signature in an interface or type literal is
  checked bivariantly even under `strictFunctionTypes`, so a driver could accept a narrower argument than its port
  promises. Every port, type and augmentation in the packages listed now spells its members as properties
  (`find: (id: string) => Promise<T>`), which TypeScript checks strictly.
  
  No runtime change. The type surface is stricter: an implementation, fake or object literal whose parameter is narrower
  than the port's now fails to typecheck, as it always should have. Module augmentations (`Matchers<R>`, `Blueprint`,
  `TestingModuleBuilder`, `TestingApp`) use the same property form.
- e756399: Publish to the Stackra registry (ADR 0453): every free `@stackra/*` package is `"private": false` (ADR 0461) with `publishConfig` `{ access: public, provenance: true }` and no registry of its own; the release workflow's `registry` input, `https://npm.stackra.figentra.com/`, is the one place it is set. The packed manifest drops the repo-only `@stackra/source` export condition. `@stackra/runway` types `providers.npm` (`registry`, `scope`); `@stackra/repo-checks` refuses a member `publishConfig.registry`; `stackra new` writes none.
