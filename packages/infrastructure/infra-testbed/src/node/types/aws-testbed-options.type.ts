/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: `AwsTestbedOptions`, what `awsTestbed` takes besides the plan: the SSH allowlist, the core lockfile the
 *          image warms its pnpm store from, an optional VPC and subnets (the default VPC otherwise), extra tags, and
 *          `groups: false` for the first apply (image pipeline only, before the first AMI exists).
 * Boundary: a type only.
 * Runtime: node
 * Governing contract: ADR 0484 (decisions 2, 3, 8, 9).
