/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: `TOOLCHAIN_PINS`, the one place the testbed's tool versions are written: the job image's Dockerfile
 *          build arguments, the host components and the recipe version all read it. A test checks `node`, `pnpm`,
 *          `infisical` and `shfmt` against the repository's `mise.toml`, and `playwright` against the catalogue, so a
 *          bump there that forgets this file fails.
 * Boundary: data only; pure and Pulumi-free.
 * Runtime: isomorphic
 * Governing contract: ADR 0484 (decision 2); ADR 0019 (exact pins); ADR 0174 (supply chain).
