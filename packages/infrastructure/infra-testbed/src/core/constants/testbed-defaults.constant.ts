/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: `TESTBED_DEFAULTS`, every default of the testbed that `stackra testbed` and `testbed-agent` also know: the
 *          region, AWS profile, SSH user, security group and key names, the group names, the AMI parameter, the tag
 *          keys, the region's vCPU quotas, the disk, guard and idle numbers, the job label, the rsync excludes, and the reserved exit codes. It
 *          is the TypeScript form of `.agents/specs/sta-1626-testbed/agent-contract.md`.
 * Boundary: data only; pure and Pulumi-free. A change here is a change to the contract, so the CLI follows it.
 * Runtime: isomorphic
 * Governing contract: ADR 0484 (decisions 3, 4, 6, 8, 9); ADR 0516 (quotas); the box agent contract of STA-1626.
