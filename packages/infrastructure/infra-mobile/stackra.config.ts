/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: the member definition of @stackra/infra-mobile: static data that gen reads from the syntax tree without
 *          running it. The member key (`infra-mobile`) is derived from the folder name; there is no key option.
 * Boundary: data only; no call other than `definePackage` and no environment read.
 * Runtime: node
 * Governing contract: ADR 0295 (decision 1); ADR 0294 (rule R12); ADR 0127 (the infrastructure category); ADR 0171
 *                     (decision 2: the infra-* packages).
