/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: `GcpHealthIndicatorDriver`, this package's driver of the contracts `HealthIndicator` port (`gcp`): the dependency is
 *          up when Google Cloud's regional endpoint for the deployment's region (Cloud Run's) answers. One GET, bounded by a timeout; any answer below 500 is `up` (the endpoint is reachable; an unsigned request is refused, as it should be), 429 is `degraded`, 500 and above is `down`.
 * Boundary: `Driver(HealthIndicator)`, so the container records the port it implements. The target is runway data passed in by the
 *           wiring; no credential is sent and none is read. A failure reports `down` with the host only, never a
 *           response body, and never throws.
 * Runtime: isomorphic
 * Governing contract: ADR 0294 (decisions 16 and 17: each infra package ships its dependency's driver), ADR 0354,
 *                     registry gaps R-27 and R-36.
