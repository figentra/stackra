/**
 * Stackra file contract:
 * Purpose: build config of @stackra/csp: one tsdown entry per package.json export (core `.` is `index`), each naming
 *          the stand-in barrel until gen writes the entry barrels (ADR 0294 decision 15, STA-339). React stays
 *          external as an optional peer.
 * Boundary: build configuration only; spreads gen's `./.stackra/tsdown.config` and lays this package's own entries
 *           (the barrels package.json `exports` names) and options over it, so gen keeps this file (ADR 0295
 *           decision 5; STA-1306, STA-1299). Before gen has run the package's own config builds alone.
 * Runtime: node
 * Governing contract: ADR 0025 (build output).
