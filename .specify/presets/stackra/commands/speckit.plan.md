## Stackra: feature directory (runs first)

Specs live in `.agents/specs/sta-<n>-<slug>/` (ADR 0120 D1), never in `specs/`. Before anything else run
`node tools/scripts/spec-gate.mjs dir` (add `--key STA-n` when the branch name carries no key). It prints the
spec folder for the branch's Linear key and writes `.specify/feature.json`. Pass that path as
`SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY=<path>` in front of every `.specify/scripts` call this command makes. If it fails,
STOP and report it; never fall back to a numbered folder.

## Stackra: gate (runs first)

`setup-plan.sh` runs `tools/scripts/spec-gate.mjs plan` and exits non-zero until the spec has
`**Clarifications status**: complete`, a `**Linear**: STA-n` key and a fully answered `## Impact`
section. If it fails, STOP: print its output, tell the user to run `/speckit.clarify`, and write
nothing. Never edit the marker yourself to get past the gate.

{CORE_TEMPLATE}

## Stackra: Planned

`plan.md` follows the Stackra plan template: every Constitution Check row is PASS or N/A with a reason, the three
deploy modes have rows, and every FR is validated by a `P-###` property (or the FR says `example-only`). Then set
`**Status**: Planned`, append the Status history line, and run `node tools/scripts/spec-gate.mjs check <folder>`.
The next step is `/speckit.tasks`.
